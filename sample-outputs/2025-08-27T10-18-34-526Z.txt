=== USER QUERY ===
in the current /delete method change the endpont for delete all books rather than delete specific one

=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the extracted content, I can see that there are already two delete methods:
1. A method to delete a specific book by its ID: `resource function delete books/[string bookId]()`
2. A method to delete all books: `resource function delete books()`

Since the project already has a method to delete all books, no changes are needed. The current implementation already meets the requirement of deleting all books when the `/books` endpoint is called with a DELETE method.

Here's an explanation of the current implementation:

1. The `delete books()` method checks if there are any books in the `bookStore`:
   - If the `bookStore` is empty (length is 0), it returns an `http:NOT_FOUND` status.
   - If books exist, it uses `bookStore.removeAll()` to clear all books.
   - It then returns an `http:NO_CONTENT` status to indicate successful deletion.

Example usage would be:
- DELETE `/books` - Deletes all books
- DELETE `/books/book123` - Deletes a specific book with ID `book123`

Since the existing implementation already supports deleting all books, no changes are required.

Feedback on tool usage:
- I used the extractRelevantContent tool to verify the current implementation
- The tool helped confirm that the delete method for all books already exists
- This prevented unnecessary modifications to the code

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of the current implementation?
