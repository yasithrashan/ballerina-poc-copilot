=== USER QUERY ===
when creating a new order add user email as a for new feature

=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the information we have, we need to:

1. Modify the `Order` record to include an `email` field
2. Update the `CreateOrderRequest` record to include an `email` field
3. Update the order creation logic to use the provided email

Let's implement these changes:

### Explanation:

To add email functionality to the order creation process, I'm making the following changes:

1. **Updating Type Definitions (`types.bal`)**:
   - Adding an `email` field of type string to the `Order` record
   - Adding an `email` field of type string to the `CreateOrderRequest` record
   - This ensures we can capture and store the user's email during order creation

2. **These changes will affect the order creation logic in the API service**:
   - When a new order is created, the email field from the request will be included in the order record
   - This doesn't require changes to the logic itself if the order creation simply copies fields from the request

3. **No database schema changes are required** since the project is using an in-memory map for storage.

The implementation ensures that all new orders will include the customer's email address, which can be used for future features like order confirmations or notifications.

<code filename="types.bal">
```ballerina
// Record representing an item in an order
type OrderItem record {
    string itemName;
    int quantity;
    decimal unitPrice;
};

// Record representing an order
type Order record {
    string orderId;
    string customerName;
    string email;
    OrderItem[] items;
    decimal totalAmount;
    string status;
    string createdAt;
};

// Request payload for creating a new order
type CreateOrderRequest record {
    string customerName;
    string email;
    OrderItem[] items;
};

// Request payload for updating an existing order
type UpdateOrderRequest record {
    string? customerName = ();
    string? email = ();
    OrderItem[]? items = ();
    string? status = ();
};

// Error response format
type ErrorResponse record {
    string message;
    string 'error;
};
```
